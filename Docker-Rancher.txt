What is container?

Container is an isolated environment where our applications (or microservice) run having all the dependencies they need attached with them.
-Zero interference
-Required resources and restricted access

Docker - Creating containers
Application containerization

Docker Hub - Public Registry for images
Images - Template-like things used to create containers
Docker Registry - Private repository

Kubernetes - Maintains communication between containers.
K8s - container orchestrator

K8s contains:-
Container
Pods - Pod is a collection of relative containers
Nodes - Node is a collection of CPU and RAM. A machine is a node for us regardless of its type.
Cluster - A group of nodes. We pool the resources of nodes to aggregate the CPU power and RAM
K8s performs scheduling, scaling, service discovery, health checkup, secret management, configuration management

K8s contains:-
etcd database - key-value store
master node(s) - stateless node which actually runs scheduler, controllers and the API server
worker nodes - application runs here

Rancher handles Multi-cloud computing or handles multiple clusters
Rancher - Kubernetes Management Platform
Rancher was able to manage Docker Swarm, Mesos(Marathon) as well as Cattle containers.
Nowadays, only K8s and cattle is supported
Rancher API - Management server (cluster controller) + worker hosts (cluster agent)
Worker hosts can create, modify and delete containers
Management server can modify services

Docker Swarm <-> Kubernetes <->Mesos

1. Rancher is 100% open source
2. Multi-cluster mgmt
3. Unified operations
4. Centralized policy mgmt
5. Authetication and RBAC, LDAP and Active Directories
6. UI
7. Integrated tooling

DC/OS - Datacenter Operating System
DC/OS is a distributed operating system based on Apache Mesos (distributed systems kernel)
DC/OS enables the management of multiple machines as if they were a single machine
-Resource management
-Process scheduling
-Inter-process communication
-Simplifies installation and mgmt of distributed services

Command to install Rancher on Digital Ocean:-

#!/bin/bash

docker run -d --restart=always -p 8080:8080 rancher/server 


Steps to install rancher on aws
1. Create a free tier account
2. Set a budget
3. Launch EC2 instance
4. Select Ubuntu (free tier eligible) as AMI for virtual machine
5. Select t2.micro as instance type
6. Configure instance > Advanced details > user data :-
#!/bin/bash

wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
docker run -d --restart=always -p 8080:8080 rancher/server

7. Configure security group > Add rules
TCP port 22, 80, 443, 8080
UDP port 500, 4500

8. Launch > Create key pair > Download .pem file > Launch instance

9. Go to EC2 console. Wait for the machine to start running.

10. Go to the public ip address of instance
http://ec2-3-83-103-135.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080

11. To launch a worker host on aws using rancher UI,
-Create an IAM user and get hold of secondary userid and password
-Check the box of programmatic access
-On permissions page, attach existing policies > Find AmazonEC2FullAcces > Create user
-Copy paste your access key id and secret key to Rancher UI
-Authenticate and select a network
-Select vpc as network
-Select rancher-machine as the security group


Note -> Don't forget to terminate machine if you were working in dev env
Delete key pair and security group as well from ec2 dashboard
