What is container?

Container is an isolated environment where our applications (or microservice) run having all the dependencies they need attached with them.
-Zero interference
-Required resources and restricted access

Docker - Creating containers
Application containerization

Docker Hub - Public Registry for images
Images - Template-like things used to create containers
Docker Registry - Private repository

Kubernetes - Maintains communication between containers.
K8s - container orchestrator

K8s contains:-
Container
Pods - Pod is a collection of relative containers
Nodes - Node is a collection of CPU and RAM. A machine is a node for us regardless of its type.
Cluster - A group of nodes. We pool the resources of nodes to aggregate the CPU power and RAM

Rancher handles Multi-cloud computing or handles multiple clusters
Rancher - Kubernetes Management Platform
Rancher can also be used to manage Docker Swarm, Mesos(Marathon) as well as Cattle containers.

Docker Swarm <-> Kubernetes <->Mesos

Docker Machine <-> Rancher

1. Rancher is 100% open source
2. Multi-cluster mgmt
3. Unified operations
4. Centralized policy mgmt
5. Authetication and RBAC, LDAP and Active Directories
6. UI
7. Integrated tooling

DC/OS - Datacenter Operating System
DC/OS is a distributed operating system based on Apache Mesos (distributed systems kernel)
DC/OS enables the management of multiple machines as if they were a single machine
-Resource management
-Process scheduling
-Inter-process communication
-Simplifies installation and mgmt of distributed services
