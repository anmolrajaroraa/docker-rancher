Rancher handles Multi-cloud computing or handles multiple clusters
Rancher - Kubernetes Management Platform
Rancher can also be used to manage Docker Swarm, Mesos(Marathon) as well as Cattle containers.

Docker Swarm <-> Kubernetes <->Mesos

Docker Machine <-> Rancher

1. Rancher is 100% open source
2. 

DC/OS - Datacenter Operating System
DC/OS is a distributed operating system based on Apache Mesos (distributed systems kernel)
DC/OS enables the management of multiple machines as if they were a single machine

-Process scheduling
-Inter-process communication
